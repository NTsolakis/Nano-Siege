## ⭐ Additional Rare Subroutines
*These should all be in the rare Subroutine category.*

Here are rare-tier Subroutines themed around:
• Fire Rate
• Range
• Burn Module
• Slow Module
• Moarter
• Laser Damage
• Tower types (Cannons, Lasers, Cryo/Slow, Burners, Moarters)

All designed to feel powerful but not run-breaking like Anomalies.

### Rare Subroutines — Tower Start-Boost Variants
1. **Cannon Auto-Tuner**  
   All Cannon Towers start at Level 2 fire rate (equivalent to +20–30% firerate depending on your system).  
   Cannon upgrades are 10% cheaper.

2. **Laser Calibration Suite**  
   All Laser Towers start at Level 2 damage, giving them a powerful opening spike.  
   Additionally, their beam applies a tiny burn (1 DPS for 1s).

3. **Cryo Preload Subroutine**  
   All Cryo/Slow Towers begin with Level 2 slow potency installed.  
   Slow duration increased by +0.3s.

4. **Thermal Injector Pack**  
   All Burn Towers start with the Burn Module pre-installed (or Level 2 burn DPS if they already had it).  
   Burn ticks have a 5% chance to ignite an additional enemy.

5. **Rangefinder Sync Network**  
   All towers start with Level 3 Range, dramatically increasing early-game map coverage.  
   Projectile towers’ shots travel faster as a side effect.

6. **Acid Core Upgrade**  
   All AoE/Moarter towers start with Level 2 Acid puddle radius.  
   Additionally, splash damage deals +10% to enemies at the very center of the explosion.

7. **Multi-Point Laser Mesh**  
   All Laser Towers begin with pierce 1  
   and get +10% fire rate to compensate for reduced burst damage style.

8. **Magnetic Shock Payload**  
   All Ballistic / Cannon towers begin with an EMP Burst Module:  
   When they kill an enemy, nearby enemies are slowed by 20% for 1 second.

9. **Trinity Module Preload**  
   Three systems start at Level 2: fire rate, range, splash radius — but only for your first 3 towers placed.

10. **Omni-Starter Package**  
    Your first tower of EACH TYPE placed starts with:  
    +10% damage • +10% fire rate • +10% range.

### Advanced Rare Subroutines — Tower Kit Combinations
11. **Auto-Fitted Burn Cannons**  
    All Cannons spawn with +1 Level to fire rate and Burn Module installed.  
    Makes cannons hybrid damage-over-time turrets.

12. **Cryo-Laser Hybridization**  
    Laser towers start with: Slow Module at Level 1 and +1 damage level.  
    Beams do tiny but meaningful slow pulses.

13. **Moarter Ignition Kernel**  
    Moarter shells instantly ignite any enemy hit by the inner 20% of their explosion radius.

14. **Stabilized Coil Array**  
    Laser towers begin with: Level 2 range and Level 1 fire rate.  
    Makes early beam setups very powerful on large maps.

15. **Modular Weapon Package (Universal Boost)**  
    ALL tower types start with +1 fire rate level BUT ability cooldowns are +10% longer (downside).  
    Balanced but powerful.

### Ultra-Flexible Rare Subroutines (Rare but Build-Defining)
16. **Arsenal Blueprint Optimization**  
    Your first three towers placed each start with: Level 2 Fire Rate, Level 2 Range, Level 1 Acid (even for non-Moarter towers → small AoE puddles).  
    This one creates extremely unique run setups.

17. **Specialty Loadout Selector**  
    When the run starts, you choose ONE tower type.  
    All towers of that type start at Level 3 in their primary stat.  
    (Equivalent to “choose your build identity.”)

18. **Nano-Fabricated Burn Mesh**  
    All towers gain the Burn Module but at 50% burn strength.  
    This creates a universal DoT build.

19. **Tri-Circuit Booster**  
    All towers gain: +5% fire rate, +5% range, +5% slow potency.  
    Solid middle-ground synergy starter.

20. **Hyperlink Enhancement**  
    Whenever you place a tower of a type you’ve already placed, the new tower starts with +1 level in that tower type’s primary stat.  
    Good for mono-type builds.
